# raspi-overclock-stats
A tool to list all the statistics a Raspberry Pi overclocker needs to monitor!

The binary file is executable, just download it and run `chmod +x ./raspi-overclock` and then you can run it with `./raspi-overclock`.

If you want it to be able to run it from anywhere, move it to your bin (`/bin/`, `/usr/bin/`, `~/.local/bin/`)

Please note that the precompiled binary file only works for the Raspberry Pi architecture.
